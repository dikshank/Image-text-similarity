# Image-text-similarity

Image-Text Similarity, is often referred to as cross-modal correlation, is a task of determining how similar a given piece of text is to a given image. This is an important problem in the field of machine learning and has numerous practical applications, including image and text retrieval, automated image captioning, visual question answering, and more.

Machine learning models frequently display both the image and the text as vectors in a high-dimensional space in order to calculate how similar the two are. This often entails training two distinct models: one for text encoding (commonly a transformer or recurrent neural network) and another for encoding images into vectors (typically a convolutional neural network).

After getting the vectors, it is possible to compare the vectors to determine how similar the image and text are. The simplest approach is to calculate the cosine similarity of the two vectors, which quantifies the angle's cosine. The degree of resemblance between the image and text is indicated by the cosine similarity score.

In actual use, these models are frequently trained on pairings of known-to-be-related images and text (such as photographs and their captions). In the vector space, the model learns to map comparable images and texts to local points and dissimilar images and texts to far-off points. ( A triplet loss function or a **contrastive loss** function can be used for this exact purpose).

These models can be improved by employing certain datasets or tasks that correspond to the intended result. You may finetune your model using a dataset of product photographs and descriptions, for instance, if your task involves matching product descriptions to images.
