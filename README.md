# Image-text-similarity

Image-Text Similarity, is often referred to as cross-modal correlation, is a task of determining how similar a given piece of text is to a given image. This is an important problem in the field of machine learning and has numerous practical applications, including image and text retrieval, automated image captioning, visual question answering, and more.

Machine learning models frequently display both the image and the text as vectors in a high-dimensional space in order to calculate how similar the two are. This often entails training two distinct models: one for text encoding (commonly a transformer or recurrent neural network) and another for encoding images into vectors (typically a convolutional neural network).
